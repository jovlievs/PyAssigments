1. Create a program to ask name and year of birth from user and tell them their age.

> What is a Palindrome String? A string is called a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the original one. Example: “madam”, “racecar”, “12321”.

5. Write a program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

6. Write a Python program to check if one string contains another.

7. Ask the user to input a sentence and a word to replace. Replace that word with another word provided by the user.  
Example:

10. Write a program that asks the user for a sentence and prints the number of words in it.  

11. Write a program to check if a string contains any digits.  


12. Write a program that takes a list of words and joins them into a single string, separated by a character (e.g., - or ,).  

13. Ask the user for a string and remove all spaces from it.  

14. Write a program to ask for two strings and check if they are equal or not.

    Example:  
    - Input: "World Health Organization"  
    - Output: "WHO"  

16. Write a program that asks the user for a string and a character, then removes all occurrences of that character from the string.  

17. Ask the user for a string and replace all the vowels with a symbol (e.g., *).  

18. Write a program that checks if a string starts with one word and ends with another.  
    Example:  
    - Input: "Python is fun!"  
    - Starts with: "Python"  
    - Ends with: "fun!"
